# Flutter Responsive Admin/Dashboard Template

### Check out [Serverpod.dev](https://cutt.ly/Per1Z7ri) - The Flutter Backend

Flutter V2.\* has officially introduced web support on its stable branch. Today, I'm excited to share a Flutter-based Admin panel, also known as a dashboard UI. This Flutter dashboard template, available on GitHub, offers a comprehensive solution for your app's backend needs. It includes a variety of features such as charts, tables, and well-designed info cards.

This Flutter dashboard library is highly versatile; it is designed to work seamlessly on the Web, macOS apps, tablets, and both Android and iOS phones. The principle of 'code once, run everywhere' is truly realized with this.
